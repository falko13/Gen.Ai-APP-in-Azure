# Gen.Ai-APP-in-Azure

## Overview

`gen.ai` leverages advanced AI models for sentiment analysis, focusing on processing and understanding dialogues. The project is currently in progress, with scripts that are under development and not yet optimized for final use. The aim is to provide a robust solution for sentiment analysis using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

## Project Status

:warning: **Project In Progress** - The scripts and components provided are in development and may undergo significant changes. They are not yet optimized for production.

## Versions

There are two main versions of this project:

### General Python Version

This version can run independently of any cloud services, demonstrating the core functionality of sentiment analysis through standalone scripts.

### Azure Python SDK 2.0 Version

Developed for the Azure Python SDK 2.0, this version utilizes the latest features and improvements as of October 2023. It aims to leverage Azure Machine Learning components and pipelines for scalable and efficient sentiment analysis.

## Components

The project is structured around two main components:

1. **Tokenization**: Prepares dialogues for analysis by tokenizing the text.
2. **Sentiment Prediction**: Predicts the sentiment of tokenized dialogues.

These components are designed to work sequentially for comprehensive sentiment analysis.
